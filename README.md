 About the license and Creative Commons
Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors
Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public
By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

CC0 1.0 Universal
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights.
A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver.
To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback.
Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Legal Code Defined
Every Creative Commons license has three layers: the lawyer-readable legal code, the human-readable deed, and the machine-readable code. As the only legally-operative layer, the legal code is the primary layer of the CC licenses. It consists of the text of the licenses, as well as any meaningful formatting and other inseparable elements listed below. The English-language, HTML-format version of the legal code is the canonical version. 

Elements of the legal code
Text of the license (excluding “Using Creative Commons licenses”, the CC notice at bottom and disclaimer at the top, as delineated below)
Title of the license (including version number)
Ordering of text in the license
Emphasis of text 
Numbering scheme
Elements of the license page that are not part of the legal code

Anything not specifically named as legal code above, including:

“CC is not a law firm” disclaimer at top
Creative Commons notice at bottom
“Using Creative Commons licenses” text and formatting
Particular method of textual emphasis within the license
Navigational links (including internal navigation links within the license text)
Link color
Text color
Coloring or design of background, including headers and footers and links they may include, pop-ups (if any), and flags
HTML and other coding that does not change the user’s view of legal code elements
Maintenance of the legal code

As part of our stewardship responsibilities, Creative Commons ensures that once published, our licenses remain unchanged and are located at a stable, canonical URL. In the course of creating official translations, some adjustments are made based on language practices, such as capitalization, section numbering schemes, punctuation, and whether the text reads from right-to left or left-to right. Additionally, we provide our licenses in various formats, including plain text. As a result, some changes are necessary depending on the style or format because some formatting from the original and official translations are not supported. 

Pre-4.0 licenses: CC maintains the legal code of its licenses completely unchanged after publication for all versions of our licenses prior to the 4.0 license suite, including ports. For all of these legal tools, licensors and licensees can depend on the text remaining static, and do not have to check back to see if anything has changed, although minor errors will continue to be documented on the errata page. Any change other than minor errata requires CC to release a new version. 

Version 4.0 license suite, CC0 1.0, and the PDM 1.0* in English: As with the pre-4.0 licenses, CC will not change the legal code of these legal tools as originally published in English. This means that CC will note minor errors in the original English of the 4.0 license suite, CC0 1.0, and PDM 1.0 on the errata page. Any change other than minor errata requires CC to release a new version.

Official translations of the 4.0 licenses, CC0 1.0 and the PDM 1.0*: CC may amend the translated legal code when any errors are identified, whether or not minor. All errors and any corrections made will be documented on the errata page. This policy is intended to help minimize potential conflicts between licensor and licensee expectations that might result from inaccuracies in a published official translation. Official translations are intended as legal equivalents. 

*Note that PDM 1.0 does not technically have a legal code layer given the nature of the tool. However, the text of the PDM and its official translations are treated as such for the purposes of this policy.

Maintenance of the non-legal code elements

Elements of the license page that are not legal code may be changed by CC in its discretion. For example, the disclaimer text may be altered, inter-language links included, or explanatory non-license text added. See above for more information about what is and is not considered legal code.

On 27 June 2018, CC updated some of the design elements of the 4.0 legal code pages, but did not change the legal code.

Legal code issues & errata
Despite our best efforts, occasionally there are issues and/or errors in the published legal code for CC legal tools. CC is committed to maintaining static, canonical versions of its legal tools, so we do not make changes to the legal code after it is published. Therefore, when issues or errors are identified, they are documented on this page. Future versions of the legal tools are adjusted to remedy these. 

Pre-4.0 versions of the licenses: Creative Commons does not amend legal code once published in pre-4.0 versions of the CC license suite, including ports and their official translations. Errata in those versions are documented on this page.  

Version 4.0 license suite, CC0 1.0, and the PDM 1.0 in English: Creative Commons does not amend the legal code once published in the original English of the 4.0 licenses and CC0, or the text of the PDM 1.0. Issues and errata are documented on this page.

Official translations of the 4.0 licenses, CC0 1.0, and PDM 1.0: Official translations of these legal tools are intended as legal equivalents of the original English. Identified errors in these official translations may be corrected. All errors and any corrections made will be fully documented on this page. (Note that errors have not been corrected in the legal code unless this page specifies that a correction has been made.) 

Issues by legal tool
CC0 1.0
Non-inclusive pronouns. The two instances of “he or she” and the two instances of “his or her” should have been written using gender-neutral pronouns (“they” and “their”). This will be changed when we next version CC0, and will be encouraged in official translations, when possible.

Description. The Deed page of CC0 1.0 refers to using “the license”; CC0 should be described as a legal tool. (This is not part of the legal code but will not be corrected until the new website is launched.)

Public Domain Mark 1.0
Description. The Deed page of PDM 1.0 refers to using “the license”; PDM should be described as a legal tool. (This is not part of the legal code but will not be corrected until the new website is launched.)

Errors by legal tool
4.0 international license suite (English)
Validated HTML
As originally published, the HTML for the license files did not validate. This was corrected; however, those with older copies of this file will have the incorrect file.

Italics
On 2019 September 24, we discovered that Section 2a5 of the 4.0 licenses had become italicized through unknown means. It was investigated and reversed back to its original formatting on 2019 November 12.

In BY-ND, the phrase for “licensed material” (“Utworu Licencjonowanego”) in section 2(a)(1)as changed to the phrase for “adapted material” (“Utworu Zależnego”) to correctly align with the original text.

Portuguese official translation (corrected on 8 September 2020)
In BY-SA, corrected the formatting of Section 1 so that the definition of Você also includes the explanation of the terms Lhe, Seu, Sua and Suas, rather than including those as a separate defined term.

In BY-NC, added missing section 6(c).

3.0 Unported (International) license suite
Section 1
Incorrect section reference.Section 1(b) of BY-SA cites Section 1(f); it should cite Section 1(h).
Incorrect word.Section 1(b) of BY-SA says that Adaptation is defined “below”; this should read “above”.
Section 3
Inconsistent language. In Section 3(d), BY-NC-SA uses “described” instead of “set forth”.
Section 8(f) reference incorrect; missing word. Section 3(b) in BY-NC-ND and Section 3c(iii) in BY-ND include a reference to Section 8(f); they should instead refer to Section 8(e). Additionally, BY-NC-ND omits the word “Section”, which should be present.
Section 4
Incorrect reference to “the Applicable License”.In section 4(b) of BY-SA and BY-NC-SA, a reference to “the Applicable License” should instead be to “this License”: “You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties” should read “You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties”.
Missing “the”.In section 4(b) of BY-NC-SA, there is a sentence reading in part “must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every copy”. This excerpt should instead read “must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy”.
Missing “the”.In Section 4(b) of BY-NC-ND, “if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears” should read “if a credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears”.
Missing numerals and capitalization.In section 4(b) of BY-NC-SA, each condition should be numbered with uppercase roman numerals. Additionally, the beginning of item (IV) should be capitalized. (The passage should read: “(I) You must include a copy of[…]”; “(II) You may not offer[…]”; “(III) You must keep intact[…]”; “(IV) When You Distribute[…]”)
Numbering of list items.In Section 4(b) of BY-NC-SA, “only under: (i) the terms of this License” should instead read “only under the terms of: (i) this License”.
Capitalization.“Collection” should be lowercase both times in the last sentence of Section 4(b) in BY-SA; the excerpts should read “as incorporated in a collection” and “does not require the collection apart from the Adaptation itself”.
Comma placement.In Section 4(c) of BY-NC and 4(d) of BY-NC-SA licenses, a comma is incorrectly placed. The text reading “and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b)” should instead read “and (iv), consistent with Section 3(b)”.
Extra hyphen.In Section 4(c) of BY-NC-SA, “con-nection” is an error, and should be written as “connection” instead.
Typographical error: “Ssection”.In Section 4(c), BY-SA contains the text “consistent with Ssection 3(b)”; “Ssection” should be “Section”.
Incorrect subsection reference.Section 4(d)(iii) of BY-NC references 4(c). It should reference 4(b).
Typographical error.In Section 4, BY, BY-NC, BY-SA, and BY-NC-SA refer to “a Adaptation”; this should be “an Adaptation”.
Extra bracket. Section 4(b)(iii) of BY-SA has an extra bracket at the end of a parenthetical.
Section 5
Omitted phrase. In BY, BY-SA, BY-NC, BY-ND, BY-NC-ND, the phrase “And to the Fullest Extent Permitted by Applicable Law,” should appear before “Licensor Offers the Work As-Is and Makes No Representations”.
Omitted word (“to”).In BY-NC-ND, “Unless Otherwise Mutually Agreed By the Parties” should read “Unless Otherwise Mutually Agreed To By the Parties”.
Spelling.“Merchantability” is misspelled as “Merchantibility” in BY, BY-NC, BY-SA, BY-ND, and BY-NC-ND.
Inconsistent language.BY-NC-SA includes the text “This Exclusion May Not Apply To You”; it should read “Such Exclusion May Not Apply To You”.
Typographical error. In all six licenses, Section 5 contains the text “OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS”. This should read “OR THE PRESENCE OF ERRORS”.
Notice
Incorrect word.In the last paragraph, “this trademark restriction does not form part of the License” should read “this trademark restriction does not form part of this License”.
3.0 jurisdiction ports
Australia
Incorrect header color.The heading for BY-NC-SA is green, and should be yellow.
Canada – English 
Misspelling. In Section 5, “Merchantability” is misspelled as “Merchantibility” in all six licenses.
Czech Republic
Typographical error.In all six licenses, the 2nd sentence of the final section (“Upozornění Creative Commons”), “Commos” should be “Commons”.
Ecuador
Incorrect header color.The headings for BY-NC, BY-NC-ND, BY-NC-SA, BY-ND are green, and should be yellow.
Germany
Incorrect word.In Section 8(e) of BY-SA, BY-NC-SA, BY-NC, BY-ND, BY-NC-ND, the word “angeboteten” should be “angebotenen”.
Greece

 About the license and Creative Commons
Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors
Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public
By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

Attribution 4.0 International
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.
License grant .
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations . For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term . The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a) .
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed . The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients .
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material . Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions . You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement . Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i) .
Other rights .
Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.
Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

Attribution .
If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.
Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.
This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
